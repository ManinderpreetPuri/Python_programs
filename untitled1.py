# a. Use for-loop to print Pascal's triangle as follows.
height=5 # height = int(input('Enter height of triangle: '))

    for count in range (2*row + 1):
        print(row,end='')

# b.Use for-loop to print table that includes 6 rows and 6 columns where the dignal should be "X".

for i in range(6):
    for j in range (6):

# c. Use for-loop to print lower triangle (dignal) of 5x5 as a '*' pattern as follows:
for i in range(6):
    for j in range(1,i+1):
        print('*', end=" ")

#d. The code below prints the numbers from 1 to 56. Rewrite the code using a while-loop.

# e. Write a program that uses a while-loop to read a string from user and then print the characters of the string one-by-one on separate lines.

#f. Write a program that asks the user for a weight and converts it from kilograms to pounds (pound= kilograms /0.45359237). 
#If the user key in a weight below 0, the program should tell the user that their entry is invalid and then ask the user to enter a new weight. 
#The program should terminate if the user enter -100. [Hint: Use a while loop only, not an if statement].
